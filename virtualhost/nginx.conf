# Reverse proxy configuration for various internal services.

# ==========================================================
# 1. Pi-hole Reverse Proxy (ph.lin)
# ==========================================================
server {
    # Listen on port 80 for incoming HTTP requests.
    listen 80;

    # The server name this block will respond to.
    # DNS must resolve 'ph.lin' to this server's IP address.
    server_name ph.lin;

    location / {
        # Forward all requests for this location to the internal Pi-hole service.
        # The trailing slash on the URL is important to ensure paths are passed correctly.
        proxy_pass http://pihole-server:8001/;

        # --- Standard Proxy Headers ---
        # These headers provide the backend service with information about the original request.

        # Pass the original 'Host' header from the client to the backend.
        proxy_set_header Host $host;

        # Pass the original client's IP address to the backend.
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

        # Append the client's IP to the list of IPs the request has passed through.
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

        # Inform the backend whether the original request was HTTP or HTTPS.
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # --- Pi-hole Specific Adjustments ---

        # Remove the 'X-Frame-Options' header to allow embedding the Pi-hole UI in an iframe.
        proxy_hide_header X-Frame-Options;

        # A custom header that some Pi-hole configurations use to identify the proxy host.
        proxy_set_header X-Pi-hole-Host $host;
    }
}

# ==========================================================
# 2. Wlingo Reverse Proxy (wlingo.lin)
# ==========================================================
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name wlingo.lin;

    location / {
        # Forward requests to the internal 'wlingo-server' application.
        proxy_pass http://wlingo-server:8002/;

        # --- Standard Proxy Headers ---
        # Pass essential information about the original request to the application.
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

# 3. pgAdmin Reverse Proxy (pgadmin.lin)
# ==========================================================

    listen 80;
    server_name pgadmin.lin;

    location / {
        # Forward requests to the internal 'pgadmin-server' application.
        proxy_pass http://pgadmin-server:5050/;

        # --- Standard Proxy Headers ---
        # Pass essential information about the original request to the application.
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
